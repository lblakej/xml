# xml
 This xml demo has a few files from [ the Web Platform](https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/styling_xml_with_css).
 
 These are indicated by files starting with "9".
 
 The other files are related to a catalog of five books. I created the xml files from scratch. These are actual books that I own and have bought from used book stores. 
 
There is an example of an xml file with no linked xsl file, an example of an xml file with a linked xsl file, and a duplicate of the xml file with no linded xsl file which has several errors that are introduced.

In this exercise we will log into OPAL and clone this repository. Then we will demo how the files work. We will also introduce the concept of editing files on the server with the [nano editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.7/nano.1.html).
