# xml
 This xml demo has a few files from [the Web Platform](https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/styling_xml_with_css).
 
 These are indicated by files starting with "9".
 
 The other files are related to a catalog of five books. I created the xml files from scratch. These are actual books that I own and have bought from used book stores. 
 
There is an example of an xml file with no linked xsl file, an example of an xml file with a linked xsl file, and a duplicate of the xml file with no linked xsl file which has several errors that we will correct with the nano editor. (see below)

In this exercise we will log into OPAL and clone this repository. Then we will demo how the files work. We will also introduce the concept of editing files on the server with the [nano editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.7/nano.1.html). We will use nano to correct the errors in the file containing errors. Although it might seen tedious, we will correct each line and save and exit. We will then refresh the browser and see a new error message. This will help you gain facility with the steps necessary to open nano, edit the file, write the file and exit back to the command line.

1. Log into your Opal account
2. ```cd public-html``` then 
3. ```git clone https://github.com/ljonesdesign/xml.git```

The 9style.css file introduces the css pseudo classes ```:before``` and ```:after```. These are not commonly used in html files, but they are very useful in working with xml.

Note that the 9style.css file uses css Shorthand properties. See comments on line 9 and 10.
